Using the String Decryptor

To decrypt a String, you will just need to copy the encrypted string into it and it should be decrypted, if you're using VB.NET as your language on dnSpy
and you see "ChrW" instructions, you can insert the value in the ChrW Numerical Bow & click add, the character will then be entered.

Alternatively, you can use the Character Table to manually select the characters you want by double clicking on them.

PS: You can also encrypt your own strings with it, however it is not recommended, knowing how the String encryptor works is usefull and can be learned about
on the "Strings And Names" documentation file

PS 2: To make sure all of the textboxes are clear, use the "Clear" button
