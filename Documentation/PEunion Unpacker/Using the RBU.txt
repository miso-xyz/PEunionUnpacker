The RBU (Raw Bytes Unpacker) is a tool present in misonothx's PEunion Unpacker that allows a protected application to be unpacked.

Q: Where can i find the protected application's bytes
A: On the tested version of PEunion (the one that is compatible with the unpacker), it is located at "Main..cctor" (this is where it is on the manually
deobfuscated example, this will differ depending on the packed application, to easily find it, you will need to find the main type, which is where all of
the code of the protected application is). You will have to select the whole section of bytes and copy it to the RBU textbox (you will have to start the
selection from the first byte and end it at the last one, no manual formating is required. An easy way to select it is by using the C# language on dnspy,
it will be much easier where you are while selecting.)

If the RBU successfully processed the given data, you will be asked to save the data as a file.
If the RBU fails to process the given data, make sure you've selected the bytes correctly & selected the correct settings. if your selection & settings
are correct, this might mean that the unpacker is incompatible with the given data.

TIP: make sure you have the protected application you want to unpack as an input file on the main menu of the application, this will allow you to use the
"Auto" feature, meaning you will not have to configure the RBU at all, you will just need to enter the protected bytes.
